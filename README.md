## Introduction

The aim of this project is to build a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions to users. It utilizes collaborative filtering techniques and explores various visualizations to gain insights into user preferences.

## Project Structure

- **data:** Contains the dataset files (`movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`).
- **src:** Source code directory with R scripts for data processing, analysis, and recommendation model.
- **docs:** Documentation files, including the README.

## Requirements

Ensure you have R installed. You can install the required R packages by running:

```bash
install.packages(c("recommenderlab", "ggplot2", "data.table", "dplyr"))
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie-recommendation-system
```
3. Execute the main R script:

```bash
Rscript src/main.R
```

## Data
The project uses two main datasets:

- *movies.csv*: Contains information about movies, including movieId, title, and genres.
- *ratings.csv*: Includes user ratings for movies, with userId, movieId, rating, and timestamp.

# Analysis and Visualizations
Explore various visualizations in the `src/visualizations`. R script. Visualizations include bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to analyze user ratings and movie popularity.

# Recommendation Model
The collaborative filtering recommendation model is implemented in the `src/recommendation`. R script. It utilizes the recommenderlab package.
